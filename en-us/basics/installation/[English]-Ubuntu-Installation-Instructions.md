## Installation on Ubuntu

This document is a PlatON installation guide on Ubuntu and is available in four installations.

- [PPA](#PPA-based-Installation)
- [Binary package](#Binary-package-based-Installation)
- [Debian package](#Debian-package-based-Installation)
- [Source code](#Source-code-based-Installation)

> Note: 
> - The official binary package, PPA source and Debian package support version 16.04 and above. 
> - When installing through official binary packages, PPA sources and Debian packages, the native CPU architectures need to be 2.0 and above , otherwise PlatON needs to be installed by compiling and encoding.

### PPA based Installation

Add the `PPA` source and install the `PlatON` client as follows. Note, there are some differences in installation methods between ubuntu18.04 and ubuntu16.04:

- Ubuntu16.04 

```bash
# Add PPA
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:platonnetwork/platon
$ sudo apt-get update

# Install Platon
$ sudo apt-get install platon-all
```
- Ubuntu18.04 

```bash
# 添加PPA
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:platonnetwork/platon
$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
$ sudo vi platonnetwork-ubuntu-platon-bionic.list
>> Change bionic to xenial in the file

$ sudo apt-get update
# Install Platon
$ sudo apt-get install platon
```

After the installation, the binaries and other components of the package should be installed to `/usr/bin`


### Binary package based Installation

```bash
# Download
$ wget https://download.platon.network/latest/platon-ubuntu-amd64.tar.gz

# 解压
$ tar -xvzf platon-ubuntu-amd64.tar.gz
```

The extracted files should be as following:

- `platon` client executable file 
- `ethkey` key generator 
- `ctool` wasm contract deploy kit 


### Debian package based Installation

```bash
# Download the `.deb` package
$ wget https://download.platon.network/latest/platon-ubuntu-amd64.deb

#installation
$ sudo dpkg -i platon-ubuntu-amd64.deb
```

After the installation, the binaries and other components of the package should be installed to `/usr/bin`

### Source code based installation

The Ubuntu build environment needs to meet the following requirements:

- System version: `Ubuntu 16.04.1 and above`
- git:`2.19.1 and above`
- Compiler: `gcc(4.9.2+)`、`g++(5.0+)`
- go language development kit: `go(1.7+)`
- cmake:`3.0+`

Note: Make sure the compilation environment requirements are met！

The PlatON compilation and installation process is as follows:


#### 1. Get the source code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go.git --recursive
```

#### 2. Compilation 

```bash
$ cd PlatON-Go
$ find ./build -name "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;
$ make all
```

After the compilation is completed, a series of executable files such as `platon` will be generated in the `PlatON-Go/build/bin` directory. You can copy the executable file to your working directory and run it as required.
